**JSGF Russian localization**

1. **The task**

NLP Challenge: JSGF Development

Background:
Below is a Context-Free Grammar written using the Java Speech Grammar Format (JSGF) (http://www.w3.org/TR/jsgf/):
~~~
#JSGF V1.0 utf-8 en;
grammar music_play;
public <music_play> =
[can you] (put on | play) (<artist> | <song>);
<artist> =
the beatles |
radiohead |
lady gaga |
pink floyd;
<song> =
comfortably numb |
paranoid android |
let it be |
hey jude;
~~~

This grammar is intended for creating utterances expressing the intent to play music, which will serve as training data for statistical intent recognition and classification models. For reference, this grammar can generate utterances like the following using a custom parser:

To better understand the parsing process, keep in mind:

Rules containing named entities that are used within the music play intent are used as tags for those entities (in this grammar, it applies to <artist> and <song>).
The parser tags everything else as unknown (<unk>).

- **Task 1.1**
  
Task 1: Extend the English Grammar
1.1 Extend the English JSGF grammar to cover at least the following utterances:
~~~
[i want to listen to]<unk> [jazz]<genre> [music]<unk>
[play me]<unk> [ummagumma]<album> [by]<unk> [pink floyd]<artist>
[put]<unk> [lady gaga]<artist> [on]<unk>
~~~


Let`s extend the JSGF file manually and see if the results will satisfy the requirements.
~~~
#JSGF V1.0 utf-8 en;
grammar music_play;
public <music_play> =
    [can you] (put on | play) (<artist> | <song>) |
    [i want to listen to] <genre> [music] |
    [play me] <album> [by] <artist> |
    [put] <artist> [on];
<artist> =
    the beatles |
    radiohead |
    lady gaga |
    pink floyd;
<song> =
    comfortably numb |
    paranoid android |
    let it be |
    hey jude;
<genre> =
    jazz;
<album> =
    ummagumma;

~~~
However, let`s confirm it by generating some utterance samples.
Now, how do we approach it?
We need to load a JSGF file, parse it, load utterances from it, check if the utterances match the grammar, and test it.
It allows us to create the following scenarios as shown in `generated_utterances_en.txt`  
~~~
üü¢put on play me ummagumma by the beatles
üü¢can you put on i want to listen to jazz music
üü¢can you play lady gaga
~~~

Task 2: Localize the JSGF Grammar in Russian
2.1 Localize the extended English grammar from Task 1.1 in Russian. Feel free to add everything you think could help improve the quality of the generated utterances.

2.2 Provide some sample utterances the JSGF can produce using the localized grammar.

2.3 What possible issues could you run into if you were asked to extend the grammar considerably, and how would you suggest overcoming them? There is no single correct response to this question, so please share any potential issues that come to mind.

2.4 Which features of your language complicate the localization or writing of the grammar? How would you solve or work around these complications?

-  **Task 2** Let's think about how we approach the Russian localization. 
üü°Does it need to be preprocessed?
This is truly an open question, but we might consider the following:
1. Normalization: Since Russian has a more flexible word order than English, it can help to normalize the word order first before translation.
  "–Ø –ø–æ—à–µ–ª –≤ –º–∞–≥–∞–∑–∏–Ω" instead of "–Ø –≤ –º–∞–≥–∞–∑–∏–Ω –ø–æ—à–µ–ª".

3. Lemmatization: Reducing inflected forms of words to their base lemma form.
  "–∏–¥—Ç–∏" instead of "—à–µ–ª", "—Ö–æ–¥–∏–ª", "–ø–æ–π–¥—É"

5. Tokenization: Breaking input text into linguistic units like words, phrases, and symbols.
   
7. Aligning source words/phrases to target translations helps learn translation patterns.
  E.g. ("went") and ("–ø–æ—à—ë–ª").
 
8. Phonetic transcription: Converting words to phonetic representations can help adapt pronunciations to the target language.

üü°The input format could be in Russian or English. `–í–∫–ª—é—á–∏ rock –º—É–∑—ã–∫—É`

üü°Original English names need to be adapted to Russian. `–ø–∞—Ä–∞–Ω–æ–∏–¥ –∞–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–∏–¥`

üü°Ending of noun change in (colloquial) speech.  `–±–∏–±–µ—Ä–∞`

üü°Slang could be used. `–∑–∞–±–∞—Ü–∞–π`
